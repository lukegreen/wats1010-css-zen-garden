Design Concepts

Overall concept

For this design, I wanted to keep things as simple, minimal and clean as possible.  I want to maximize readability and maintain a sense of openness and space.  This design is inspired by my visits to actual Zen gardens in Japan.  I admire these spaces for their exhaltation of emptiness punctuated by 'islands' of substance (e.g, rocks, moss, buildings, etc.).

Impact

My goal is to provide the reader with a comfortable and meditative browsing experience.  Content will be sparse, separated by tracts of empty space.  Content areas will encourage interactivity through simple animations, like hover interactions, etc. Color palatte will be desaturated, or even grayscale.  Part of the goal is to allow the reader to move from content area to content area easily, so menus on left and right will be fixed, while the main text area in the center will scroll.  Perhaps text fade-in and fade-out animations could trigger as the reader scrolls, lending a sense of the emphemeral (a major theme in Zen), like clouds moving in and out of the atmosphere.  I will utilize a simple, unobtrusive background image to imply a sense of place. I'd like for the reader to feel like they are strolling through an empty monestery.

This is the top design on CSS zen garden.  Love the color palate, broad areas of color without borders, modernist design sensibilities.

I love the openess of this design.  Gives me the feeling of being outdoors.

Like the first site, I like the distinct color areas and rectilinear "section-ness" of this design.Like
